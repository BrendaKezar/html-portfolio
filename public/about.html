<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a writer currently dabbling in art and programming.</p>

<p>
  I am a corgi fanatic and have three corgis: a corgi-bulldog mix, a purebred
  pembroke, and an (allegedly) American corgi (pembroke-cardigan cross, but I
  think he's got some cattle-dog in him).
</p>

<p>
  I love to spend time outdoors and can often be found camping, hiking, or
  fishing.
